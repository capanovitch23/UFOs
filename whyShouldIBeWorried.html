                        <p>One night in 1952, around 10 unidentifiable objects were identified on radars at 3 separate airports in Washington D.C. The objects on the radar were also visible in the night sky, and thousands of onlookers reported to have seen them. For multiple hours, the objects moved erratically through the night sky, performing aerial manuevers that defied the laws of physics. The U.S Air Force even dispatched a fighter jet to intercept the objects, but they were able to easily outmanuever even our fastest aircraft. After the fact, the government attempted to claim that everything the publci saw that night was an optical allusion. However, due to the amount of witness reports and the credibility of those who identified them with telescopes and radars, it is without a doubt that what was witnesseed that night was not from Earth.

In 1964, a New Mexico police officer named Lonnie Zamoura was distracted suddenly by a loud noise he had heard. He looked over, and saw what looked to be an object with a flame coming out of the bottom descending towards the Earth. After running over to investigate, he saw two men in hazmat suits standing next to what appeared to be a pill-shaped object. The two men ten entered the aircraft and it ascended back into the sky. The aircraft in question was likely an alien spacecraft, as its shape and technology indicates that it is a creation of an advanced civilization. Although Zamouraâ€™s description was the most descriptive, there were multiple other witnesses to observe the spacecraft, and there was no real evidence to disprove his sightings. The government never offered any sort of explanation for what had happened, and Zamoura was adamant about his sighting until the day he died. It should also be noted that Zamoura was known to be an honest and credible man throughout his life.

                        <p>Off the coast of Mexico in 2004, the U.S. Coast Guard was performing a training exercise on an aircraft carrier when they noticed strange appearances on their radar systems. Every pass of the radar would pick up varying numbers of objects, and each time they had performed seemingly impossible maneuvers. When crew members went out to the deck to investigate, they were able to see white specks far off in the sky moving erratically. The Coast guard ended up dispatching two fighter jets to investigate the disturbance, and they both identified what appeared to be a pill shaped object moving erratically close to the water, making random side-to-side movements while maintaining a constant altitude. When one of the pilots attempted to get closer to the object, it immediately shot up into the sky at an impossible speed. This is without a doubt a real UFO, and it is most likely not operated by humans. This story has been vouched for by numerous high-ranking officers in the Coast Guard, all of whom have decades of experience and could not be more qualified to talk about a topic like this.</p>
