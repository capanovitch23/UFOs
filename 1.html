        <p>Lue Elizondo was a man who once worked for the Department of Defense, heading the UAP research plan (Notice how they started calling them Unidentified Aerial phenomena to distract us!). Elizondo was a brilliant man who was devoted to his work, and he knew that UFOs were real and that they posed a threat to our society. His higher-ups, however, did not agree. Elizondo was eventually pressured to resign, but he still works to this day to help ensure that the truth comes out about other-worldly threats.
