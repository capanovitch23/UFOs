                        <p>Luis Elizonda has spent years of his life researching UFOs, and has heard countless detailed stories describing UFOs and alien encounters, many of which were credible. When Elizondo realized the gravity of the situation he was in, he knew immediately that he had to contact his superiors to inform them of the immediate threat that UFOs faced. When trying to contact one of his superiors, James “Mad Dog” Mattis, he was stopped by another superior of his, who strongly urged him to stop. He attempted to push Christian ideology onto Elizondo and accused him of being a satanist. Elizondo later resigned out of frustration with his position.

Elizondo has spent the last few years since his resignation as a whistleblower trying to spread the truth about UFOs and their danger. The amount of courage it took to stand up against the government that tried to silence you is amazing, and we at UFO.com sincerely thank Elizondo for his contributions to our project.
