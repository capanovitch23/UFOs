                        <p>When more carbon dioxide is emitted into the earth than it can handle, it will increase the greenhouse effect on the planet. This would cause, and increase, global warming and its effects, such as climate change.

                        <p>Global warming is one of the undesirable effects of a high carbon footprint. If global warming were to become extreme, --which is the path we are currently on-- it would cause unpredictable and extreme weather, like tropical storms, cyclones, blizzards, droughts, and much worse. With each passing year this will occur more often with a growing intensity. Global Warming would also have the effects of melting polar ice caps. This would raise sea level by approximately 230 feet. This would put most of the coast of East Coast, Florida, and Gulf Coast underwater. Cities such as New York City, Huston, and Washington DC will have become coastal cities. Not only would this put almost 1/4 of the United States underwater, but would also cause millions of people to lose their homes and family land. In addition, this would also cause a decrease in available farmland, and a reduction in soil quality, potentially leading to a famine.</p>

                        <p>2020 was the hottest year on record since 2016. It is predicted that by the year 2050, if nothing changes, the entire global temperature could rise by as much as 3.6 F. This is all being caused by the common burning of fossil fuels. The most common types of fossil fuels burned by the average person are gasoline and coal. These fuels are also some of the most destructive and have the most adverse effects. Everybody can do their part in reducing their emissions by cutting down their burning of these particular fossil fuels, and choosing alternative fuels whenever possible.</p>
