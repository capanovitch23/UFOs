                        <p>UFOs were first discovered in 1947 when news agencies received an influx of reports from people who described seeing strange objects in the sky. Kenneth Arnold, a pilot who was flying over Washington, gave a vivid description of the objects and coined the term that would eventually become ubiquitous for describing UFOs: flying saucer. He described the UFOs as travelling at over 2000 km/h, a speed that was faster than any human-built aircraft at the time.

                        <p>Immediately, and without hesitation, the U.S. airforce became defensive and quickly shut down any theories about the strange objects. They stated that the objects were no more than optical illusions, despite the numerous independent reports and vivid descriptions of the appearance of the objects.

                        <p>Over the coming weeks, however, media coverage on the flying saucers grew to an all time high, and the government quickly began to investigate UFOs and their mysterious origins. In declassified research papers, the government expresses their concerns over the possibility that UFOs could be aliens, foreign government agencies, or both.
